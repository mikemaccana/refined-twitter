# <img src="extension/icon.png" width="45" align="left"> Refined Twitter

An extension that makes Chrome always use the [mobile web version of Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com), which is much faster and better looking than the old [desktop web](https://twitter.com/) version. When you open a link that would normally be to desktop Twitter, this extension redirects you to the mobile web version and makes it wider.

I'm happy to receive feature requests. See [refined-github](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github#highlights) for inspiration of the possibilities.
